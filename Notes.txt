Notes:
1. This project runs on Tomcat 8.0 and JDK 1.8 using Eclipse
2. If there is 45-second timeout error when starting, please increase the timeout value of Tomcat to 120 seconds or more
3. All initial data is populated automatically, done by init() function inside MovieDao class
4. By default, the Home page lists all available movies
5. When clicking Search, only movies which match the query are displayed
6. I haven't done the Search page yet due to lacking of time :(
